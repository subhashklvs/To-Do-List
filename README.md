# To-Do-List
The To-Do List Desktop App is a simple task manager built using Python and Tkinter. It provides a clean GUI to add, view, and delete daily tasks. Completed tasks can be removed easily, and all tasks are automatically saved to a local JSON file so they remain available after closing and reopening the application.
